mock store using mysql

Synopsis

This code is a mock inventory.  It will list all our products with a id number and price.  It will then ask you what number you want and then how many quantities of that item.  It will then take your input and check the datebase to see if we have enough to sell you.  If we do we will give you a total and then subtrack from the inventory.  If we do not have enough inventory we will tell you that.

Code Example

? What is the Product ID Number of the item you want to purchase? 7
? quantity? 10
total owed: $22.50

Motivation

This was a homework assignment.

API Reference

this uses NPM packages mySQL and inquirer
